    "# Data Introduction\n",
    "Many individuals enter college or university with an idea of what they want to focus their career on. However, there are many instances where these same individuals end up changeing their choice of career. I have always been curious about the factors that influence career changes. I want to explore how someone's field of study impacts their likelihood to stick with or switch their careers. According to the distributor and maintainer, this dataset is designed to help explore and predict whether individuals are likely to change their occupation based on their academic background, job experience, and other demographic factors.\n",

    "It is unknown where this data origniated from and everything is completely annonymous. This could be a potential bias as it could provide the opporunity of eliminating some subset of bias.
